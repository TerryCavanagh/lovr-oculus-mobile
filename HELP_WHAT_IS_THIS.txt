This is a copy of ovr_sdk_mobile_1.16.0 with a custom program written into VrSamples/VrCubeWorld_Framework. The entire thing is written into version control because the modifying the sdk itself seems to be sometimes necessary while writing software for Oculus mobile.

## To build (Mac instructions):

* The submodule cmakelib/lovr has submodules. If you did not initially clone this repo with --recurse-submodules, you will need to run `(cd cmakelib/lovr && git submodule init && git submodule update)` before doing anything else.

* Install Android Studio

* Open Android Studio, go into Preferences, search in the box for "SDK". use the "Android SDK" pane to download Android API level 21. Now quit Android Studio (in my testing it is broken and will break your project).

* Run:

        PATH="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/bin":~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools:$PATH adb devices

    Get your id number for the device.

* Plug the id number from adb into [https://dashboard.oculus.com/tools/osig-generator/]

* Copy the file downloaded from osig-generator into `LovrApp/assets`

* cd `LovrApp/Projects/Android`

* ```PATH="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/bin":~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools:$PATH ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk ../../../gradlew installDebug```

* **IF IT FAILS WITH A MESSAGE ABOUT `z_crc_t`:**

	* Edit the file `cmakelib/lovr/deps/assimp/CMakeLists.txt`. On the first line, insert:

		message(FATAL_ERROR fake_failure)

	* Rerun the `installDebug` step. It will fail again, this time with the message "fake_failure".

	* Remove the line you just added to `cmakelib/lovr/deps/assimp/CMakeLists.txt`.

	* Rerun the `installDebug` step again. This time it will succeed.

	* Yes, this is *completely ridiculous*. :(

Notes: 
* To see other things gradlew can do run it with "tasks" as the argument.
* The reason for the long PATH/ANDROID_HOME line is to get the java and android tools into scope for that line. You could also just modify the env vars in your bashrc.
* You have to have turned on developer mode on your headset before deploying.
* If it gets stuck complaining about "unauthorized", try putting on the headset and see if there's a permissions popup.

## To make your own app:

Decide on a name for your app and also an identifier (this is something like "com.companyname.gametitle").

Edit `LovrApp/Projects/build.gradle`. Change "project.archivesBaseName" and "applicationId" to reflect your identifier.

Edit `LovrApp/Projects/Android/AndroidManifest.xml`. Change "package=" at the top to your identifier and change "android:label=" partway down (right after YOUR NAME HERE) to your name.
