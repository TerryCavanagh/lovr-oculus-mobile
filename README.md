This is a repository for building LovrApp, a standalone Android app which is based on the [LÃ–VR](lovr.org) VR API.

# Usage

## To build (Mac instructions):

* The submodule cmakelib/lovr has submodules. If you did not initially clone this repo with --recurse-submodules, you will need to run `(cd cmakelib/lovr && git submodule init && git submodule update)` before doing anything else.

* Install Android Studio

* Open Android Studio, go into Preferences, search in the box for "SDK". use the "Android SDK" pane to download Android API level 21. Now quit Android Studio (in my testing it is broken and will break your project).

* Run:

        PATH="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/bin":~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools:$PATH adb devices

    Get your id number for the device.

* Plug the id number from adb into [https://dashboard.oculus.com/tools/osig-generator/]

* Copy the file downloaded from osig-generator into `LovrApp/assets`

* You need to build the gradle scripts in `deps/openal-soft` and `cmakelib`, then run the installDebug target of the gradle script in `LovrApp/Projects/Android`. You can do this with the `gradlew` script in the root, but it will need the Android tools in `PATH` and the sdk install location in `ANDROID_HOME`. You can just run this at the Bash prompt from the repository root to do all of this:

        (export PATH="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/bin":~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools:$PATH ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk GRADLE=`pwd`/gradlew; (cd deps/openal-soft-gradle && $GRADLE build) && (cd cmakelib && $GRADLE build) && (cd LovrApp/Projects/Android && $GRADLE installDebug)) && say "Done"

Notes:
* You have to have turned on developer mode on your headset before deploying.
* If it gets stuck complaining about "unauthorized", try putting on the headset and see if there's a permissions popup.
* If you get a message about "signatures do not match the previously installed version", run this and try again:

        PATH="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/bin":~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools:$PATH adb uninstall com.lovr.appsample

* If all you have done is changed the assets, you can upload those by running only the final `installDebug` gradlew task. For example:

        (export PATH="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/bin":~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools:$PATH ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk GRADLE=`pwd`/gradlew; (cd LovrApp/Projects/Android && $GRADLE installDebug))

* To see all the things gradlew can do in a particular directory run it with "tasks" as the argument.
* The reason for the long PATH/ANDROID_HOME line is to get the java and android tools into scope for that line. You could also just modify the env vars in your bashrc.

Help would be appreciated if you know how to do any of the following: Make the build work in Android Studio; make the build work in Windows; make the build work in a single gradle pass without having to invoke `gradlew` three times.

## Adding game code:

The game code should be put in `LovrApp/assets`. Alternately, you can place your own directory somewhere and put the path to it on the `assets.srcDirs = ['../../assets', '../../../your/path/here']` line of `LovrApp/Projects/Android/build.gradle`. This will be uploaded when LovrApp's installDebug runs.

## To ship your own app:

Decide on a name for your app and also an identifier (this is something like "com.companyname.gametitle").

Edit `LovrApp/Projects/build.gradle`. Change "project.archivesBaseName" and "applicationId" to reflect your identifier.

Edit `LovrApp/Projects/Android/AndroidManifest.xml`. Change "package=" at the top to your identifier and change "android:label=" partway down (right after YOUR NAME HERE) to your name.

# Contributing

## Upgrading

This repository has a branch "oculus-original-sdk". As commits, this branch has versions of some versions of official Oculus Mobile SDK releases (with those samples which are not necessary, notably the ones with large embedded video samples, deleted).

If you need to upgrade the version of Oculus Mobile SDK used by this release, you should do so by checking out the "oculus-original-sdk" branch, unpacking the latest ovr_sdk_mobile package into the repository, committing, and then merging back into the master branch. This will ensure that changes to the SDK are cleanly incorporated.
